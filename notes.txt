Bill Split Notes

When Checkbox is Clicked
-get the item it's associated with
-if checkbox is checked, then change index of owner to 1 in the item object
== +1 to owner total
-if checkbox is unchecked, then change the index of owner to 0 in the item object
== -1 to owner total
[] done

Calculate()
-do (price/ownersClaimed) to get the total for each claimed person
-iterate through items object array
==look at the item Objects 'claimed' attrbute [0,0,1,0,1]
*** every time there is a 1:
==> push the item name onto the Owner object's "claimed items" array (secondary)
==> add the subtotal to the Owner objects 'total' attribute
[]done

OnOKButtonClick()
-add a function to handle when user clicks OK for the 2nd time (or more)
-if newNumUsers < currentNumUsers, delete the last owner option and last object in the array
-if newNumUsers > currentNumUsers, add one more option after the last owner option
    and after the last object in the owner array

Make a div around the owner-option list so that a hide list button can be added

addTax(t){
     user enters a flat amount
    --caculate the proportionate amount of tax
    --push it as an item into each owner object
    getProportions(t);

}

getProportions(){
    beforeTaxTotal = running total;
    proportionArray = [length num owners];
    --iterate through array to calc each owner's proortion of subtotal
    proportionarray[i] = float owner[i].total/beforeTaxTotal
}

TO DO
Add a discount function
Add a function to calculate the tip
Disable all functions until number of participants is entered [] done
Change functions so when user clicks out of inputbox,  
    it takes the current input as final value []
User doesnt enter anything into textbox []
consolidate rename owners button into 1 button. when clicked, all input fields for owners will appear
